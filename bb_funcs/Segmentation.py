    Master Segmenter Function
    
    Many curated steps that render nice segmentations of PAA Beads inside Zebrafish
    embryos. The user has 5 main parameters to tune,explained below:
    After innumerable trials and errors, this seems like a sound code.
    All steps are absolutely necessary to achieve a proper segmentation.
